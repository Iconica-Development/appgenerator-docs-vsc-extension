# Appgenerator Docs Extension

This extension is made for the [HydroPlatform repository](https://github.com/SiebeBosch/HydroPlatform). It helps the end user by providing documentation when creating apps in a .yaml or .yml file. 

## Features

When editing a .yaml or .yml file, a pop-up window with documentation will open when hovering over a key. For instance, when hovering over `button`, the extension will open the documentation for the button in a pop-up window.
